# NotSoCereal-Lab: A Deserialization exploit playground

Deserialization issues are the newest trendy topics in Information Security. They rose to fame with infamous java deserialization bugs however the issues are not just limited to one language. Serialization and De-serialization are common actions and are performed by almost all modern languages.

As big of a news these issues are, there is serious lack of playgrounds for honing your skill in such topics. This is where NotSoCereal comes into picture.

NotSoCereal is a exploitation playground for Deserialization Issues, at this point it contains issues in Java, PHP, and python and we are working on bringing more languages to the fold.
